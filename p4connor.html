                <h2>About Connor:-</h2>
                <p id="aboutconnor">Connor primary mission is to investigate and deal with cases involving deviant androidsâ€”those who have deviated from their 
                    programmed behavior and begun exhibiting signs of free will.</p>
            </article>

                    <h3>Personality of Connor</h3>
                    <p>Connor, in the beginning, is indifferent to the treatment of androids in Detroit. 
                        When the game first begins he is shown flicking a quarter coin (US currency, 1994 issue) 
                        between his hands and fingers while waiting in the elevator, a unique characteristic of his android programming. 
                        How he came by this particular coin remains to be seen, but it is explained that Connor flicks his coin to
                        calibrate his physical and cognitive functions, sharpening himself for the challenges ahead.At Chicken Feed, 
                        Connor explains to Hank that his facial features and voice were designed for harmonious and seamless integration 
                        with humans. This explains his unassuming expression and his clear and concise diction.Although he may have 
                        consciousness, his core programming is to complete the mission, going to lengths of self-sacrifice to complete
                        his mission.From the start, Connor is a neutral character. Depending on the player's choices,
                        Connor's core personality throughout the game can take several directions. For example, utilizing the choices
                        that keep Connor focused on accomplishing his mission will result in his portrayal as a cold, ruthless individual
                        only interested in completing his mission by any means necessary, even if it means betraying or killing his 
                        own people or his friends. Conversely, the player could choose to make him a more sympathetic, pacifist character
                        who refuses to kill his own people.</p>

                    <h3>Ability of Connor</h3>
                    <p>Connor has the ability to scan and analyze a scene and recreate events that took place in a reconstruction.
                        This unlocks new dialogue choices and narrative paths.His ability to reconstruct a sequence of events is both
                        hyper-advanced and entirely unique to him. To perform a reconstruct, 
                        physical and circumstantial details must first be analyzed in isolation,
                        providing vital information such as the direction of travel, velocities, and trajectories, 
                        likely collisions based on material density and friction, etc.Connor can analyze biological evidence 
                        (such as blood samples) in real time by putting them on his tongue to "taste" them. He can identify blood types,
                        DNA (including identifying a specific human), drugs, sample age, and probably more. The same applies to android blood,
                        where he can determine the model and serial number. Connor is able to reconstruct events and crimes from the 
                        gathered data using a physical simulation software. With it, Connor's cutting-edge processors simulate the most
                        probable version of events leading to the picture of evidence he has just discovered and analyzed, with 
                        every element playing a part in his cognitive simulation. Similarly, he can preconstruct events:
                        He can also predict the probability of an imminent event, physical and mental status of other androids, 
                        showing as the statistic in his internal interface, which he can refer to decide on his choices.</p>
